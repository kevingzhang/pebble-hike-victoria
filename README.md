pebble-hike-victoria
====================

This is a weekend project to help local Pebble hiking group to organize weekend hiking in Victoria,BC

Kevin@2/18/2014: I created the framework and let Neil catch up.
The current version can post new hike with link to google map, other people can join/maybe/deny. They can also post comments.

TODO: next I will add features to upload pictures. So that people can see history hikes with pictures on it.
